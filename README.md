## Rehabilitation Game by: Waleed Rinawi, Thaer Abu Tayeh, and Yaser Hegazi
Our project is an IOT device that is used to run various different tests on patients undergoing rehabilitation. These tests cover many different aspects of the
patient's senses and cognitive ability. For example, we have tests that include the use of auditory and visual interactions with the patients. The project also
includes an application by the name of Rehapp Friend which is used by the doctors of these patients in order to use the device. The application also provides the
doctors with many different graphs and statistics to help them monitor their patients' progress easily and efficiently.
